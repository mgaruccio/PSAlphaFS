# PSAlphaFS
Powershell Wrapper for the AlphaFS .Net modules located at http://alphafs.alphaleonis.com/

Ok, so this is just getting started but the basic goal is to provide a powershell wrapper for the alphafs .Net library

So far copy and delete operations are partially implemented

Still have a long way to go and would really appreciate any help that can be provided
